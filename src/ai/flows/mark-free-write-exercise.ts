    - Lesson Content: {{{lessonContext}}}
    - Question Asked: {{{question}}}
    - User's Answer: {{{userAnswer}}}

    2. Provide brief, constructive feedback. If they are correct, be encouraging. If they are incorrect, gently correct them and point them in the right direction without giving away the direct answer.
